PROCESSING MNIST DATASET AND IMPLEMENTING kNN ALGORITHM USING LIST

1 Assignment’s outcome
After completing this assignment, students review and make good use of:
• Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
• List data structures
• Sorting algorithms
2 Introduction
Classification is one of the fundamental and most common tasks in machine learning. The goal
of classification is to categorize data into different groups (classes) based on their characteristics.
Some simple examples of classification problems include classifying emails as spam or non-spam,
classifying images as cat or dog, and so on. In this assignment, students will become acquainted
with the simple classification algorithm k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and apply this algorithm
to process and classify the MNIST dataset.
Students are required to implement a class that provides users with the ability to process the MNIST dataset, as well as a class that efficiently implements the kNN classification
algorithm using list data structures.
