# **Processing MNIST Dataset and Implementing kNN Algorithm Using List**

## **1. Assignment Outcome**
After completing this assignment, students will gain a solid understanding of:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **List Data Structures**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
## **2. Introduction**
Classification is one of the fundamental and most common tasks in machine learning. The goal of classification is to categorize data into different groups (classes) based on their characteristics.  

Some simple examples of classification problems include:
- Classifying emails as **spam or non-spam**.
- Classifying images as **cat or dog**.
- Recognizing handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**.

In this assignment, students will implement the **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification algorithm** and apply it to process and classify the **MNIST dataset** using **list data structures**.
